# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04

## 1. Introduction
Spriters Bot ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our bot on Discord.

## 2. Data We Collect
We collect the minimum data necessary to operate the bot:
- **Server Information:** Guild ID, server name, channel list.
- **User Information:** User ID, username, discriminator (limited to command interactions).
- **Configuration Data:** Settings you customize (e.g., auto-cleaning filters, anti-spam rules, custom dates).
- **Logs:** A temporary, local history of administrative actions (logs are stored per-server and rotated automatically; we do not keep permanent logs off-platform).

## 3. How We Use Your Data
- To provide bot features (cleaning, moderation, notifications).
- To persist your server preferences (language, timezones).
- To audit bot actions within your server (logs are viewable by your server admins).

## 4. Data We DO NOT Collect
- **Private Messages:** We do not read, store, or process Direct Messages (DMs).
- **Message Content (Storage):** We scan messages for Anti-Spam (if enabled) in real-time but **do not store** message content in any external database. Content is kept in volatile memory (RAM) for a few seconds only for flood detection and then discarded.
- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** We do not collect names, addresses, or emails.

## 5. Data Retention
- **Configurations:** Stored until you remove the bot or reset settings.
- **Logs:** The last 50 actions are stored locally for display in the `/logs` command. Older logs are overwritten automatically.

## 6. Your Rights
You may request:
- Deletion of your server's data.
- Transparency about specific data stored.
To exercise these rights, please contact the developer or remove the bot from your server (which stops data collection and essentially deletes config references over time).

## 7. Contact
For privacy concerns, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact the developer via Discord.
